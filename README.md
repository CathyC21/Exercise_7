API parsing in P5.js

	Using an open API, parse the json or XML data to pull out various
 	bits of information.
	Then visualize this information on the screen in some way.

	You can use the JSON file here called "rats.js." OR use another open API.
	(OpenWeatherMap)[http://openweathermap.org/API] is another API that does not require API keys.

	A few others are listed at the bottom of this link:
